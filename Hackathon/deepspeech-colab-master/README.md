# deepspeech-colab
This repo contains an Interactive Python notebook, authored for Google's Colaboratory platform, to run Mozilla's DeepSpeech model (based on the DeepSpeech paper authored by Baidu Research).

You can use this notebook to figure out how to run deep learning models on the Colab infrastructure, specially those which depend on NVIDIA CUDA as a dependency (since Colab walls off access to CUDA binaries in GPU mode).

To run this notebook, upload it to Colab (http://colab.research.google.com).

**Note:** The notebook might stop working owing to updated dependencies, specially for NVIDIA's binaries.
